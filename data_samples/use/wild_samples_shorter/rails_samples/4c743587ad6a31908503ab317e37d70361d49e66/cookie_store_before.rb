    # By default, your secret key base is derived from your application name in
    # the test and development environments. In all other environments, it is stored
    # encrypted in the <tt>config/credentials.yml.enc</tt> file.
    #
    # If your application was not updated to Rails 5.2 defaults, the secret_key_base
    # will be found in the old <tt>config/secrets.yml</tt> file.

route/max_size - INTEGER
	Maximum number of routes allowed in the kernel.  Increase
	this when using large numbers of interfaces and/or routes.
	From linux kernel 3.6 onwards, this is deprecated for ipv4
	as route cache is no longer used.

	Minimum number of entries to keep.  Garbage collector will not
	purge entries if there are fewer than this number.

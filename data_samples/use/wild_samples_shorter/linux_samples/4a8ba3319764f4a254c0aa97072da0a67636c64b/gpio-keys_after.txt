Each button (key) is represented as a sub-node of "gpio-keys":
Subnode properties:

	- gpios: OF device-tree gpio specification.
	- interrupts: the interrupt line for that input.
	- label: Descriptive name of the key.
	- linux,code: Keycode to emit.

Note that either "interrupts" or "gpios" properties can be omitted, but not
both at the same time. Specifying both properties is allowed.

Optional subnode-properties:
	- linux,input-type: Specify event type this button/key generates.
	  If not specified defaults to <1> == EV_KEY.
	- debounce-interval: Debouncing interval time in milliseconds.
	  If not specified defaults to 5.
	- gpio-key,wakeup: Boolean, button can wake-up the system.
	- linux,can-disable: Boolean, indicates that button is connected
	  to dedicated (not shared) interrupt which can be disabled to
	  suppress events from the button.

Example nodes:

1. Acquisition Orders
---------------------

The acquisition orders for mutexes are as follows:

- kvm->lock is taken outside vcpu->mutex

- kvm->lock is taken outside kvm->slots_lock and kvm->irq_lock

- kvm->slots_lock is taken outside kvm->irq_lock, though acquiring
  them together is quite rare.

For spinlocks, kvm_lock is taken outside kvm->mmu_lock.  Everything
else is a leaf: no other lock is taken inside the critical sections.

2: Exception

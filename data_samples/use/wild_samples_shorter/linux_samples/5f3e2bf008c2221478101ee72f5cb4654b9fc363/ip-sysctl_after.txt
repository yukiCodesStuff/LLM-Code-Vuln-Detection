	Path MTU discovery (MTU probing).  If MTU probing is enabled,
	this is the initial MSS used by the connection.

tcp_min_snd_mss - INTEGER
	TCP SYN and SYNACK messages usually advertise an ADVMSS option,
	as described in RFC 1122 and RFC 6691.
	If this ADVMSS option is smaller than tcp_min_snd_mss,
	it is silently capped to tcp_min_snd_mss.

	Default : 48 (at least 8 bytes of payload per segment)

tcp_congestion_control - STRING
	Set the congestion control algorithm to be used for new
	connections. The algorithm "reno" is always available, but
	additional choices may be available based on kernel configuration.

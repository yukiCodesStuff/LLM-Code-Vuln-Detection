==============================================================

protected_fifos:

The intent of this protection is to avoid unintentional writes to
an attacker-controlled FIFO, where a program expected to create a regular
file.

When set to "0", writing to FIFOs is unrestricted.

When set to "1" don't allow O_CREAT open on FIFOs that we don't own
in world writable sticky directories, unless they are owned by the
owner of the directory.

When set to "2" it also applies to group writable sticky directories.

This protection is based on the restrictions in Openwall.

==============================================================

protected_hardlinks:

A long-standing class of security issues is the hardlink-based
time-of-check-time-of-use race, most commonly seen in world-writable

==============================================================

protected_regular:

This protection is similar to protected_fifos, but it
avoids writes to an attacker-controlled regular file, where a program
expected to create one.

When set to "0", writing to regular files is unrestricted.

When set to "1" don't allow O_CREAT open on regular files that we
don't own in world writable sticky directories, unless they are
owned by the owner of the directory.

When set to "2" it also applies to group writable sticky directories.

==============================================================

protected_symlinks:

A long-standing class of security issues is the symlink-based
time-of-check-time-of-use race, most commonly seen in world-writable

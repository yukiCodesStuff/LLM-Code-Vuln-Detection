	nospectre_v1	[X86,PPC] Disable mitigations for Spectre Variant 1
			(bounds check bypass). With this option data leaks are
			possible in the system.

	nospectre_v2	[X86,PPC_FSL_BOOK3E,ARM64] Disable all mitigations for
			the Spectre variant 2 (indirect branch prediction)
			vulnerability. System may allow data leaks with this

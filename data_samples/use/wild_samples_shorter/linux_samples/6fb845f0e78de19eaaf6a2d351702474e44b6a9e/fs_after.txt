dentry-state:

From linux/include/linux/dcache.h:
--------------------------------------------------------------
struct dentry_stat_t dentry_stat {
        int nr_dentry;
        int nr_unused;
        int age_limit;         /* age in seconds */
        int want_pages;        /* pages requested by system */
        int nr_negative;       /* # of unused negative dentries */
        int dummy;             /* Reserved for future use */
};
--------------------------------------------------------------

Dentries are dynamically allocated and deallocated.

nr_dentry shows the total number of dentries allocated (active
+ unused). nr_unused shows the number of dentries that are not
actively used, but are saved in the LRU list for future reuse.

Age_limit is the age in seconds after which dcache entries
can be reclaimed when memory is short and want_pages is
nonzero when shrink_dcache_pages() has been called and the
dcache isn't pruned yet.

nr_negative shows the number of unused dentries that are also
negative dentries which do not mapped to actual files.

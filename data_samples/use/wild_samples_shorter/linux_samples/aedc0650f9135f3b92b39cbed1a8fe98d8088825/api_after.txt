----------------------

The kvm API is a set of ioctls that are issued to control various aspects
of a virtual machine.  The ioctls belong to the following classes:

 - System ioctls: These query and set global attributes which affect the
   whole kvm subsystem.  In addition a system ioctl is used to create
   virtual machines.
#define KVM_PMU_EVENT_ALLOW 0
#define KVM_PMU_EVENT_DENY 1

4.121 KVM_PPC_SVM_OFF

Capability: basic
Architectures: powerpc
Type: vm ioctl
Parameters: none
Returns: 0 on successful completion,
Errors:
  EINVAL:    if ultravisor failed to terminate the secure guest
  ENOMEM:    if hypervisor failed to allocate new radix page tables for guest

This ioctl is used to turn off the secure mode of the guest or transition
the guest from secure mode to normal mode. This is invoked when the guest
is reset. This has no effect if called for a normal guest.

This ioctl issues an ultravisor call to terminate the secure guest,
unpins the VPA pages and releases all the device pages that are used to
track the secure pages by hypervisor.

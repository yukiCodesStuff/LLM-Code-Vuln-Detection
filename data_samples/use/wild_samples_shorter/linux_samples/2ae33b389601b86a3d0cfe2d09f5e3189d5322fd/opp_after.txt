1.1 What is an Operating Performance Point (OPP)?

Complex SoCs of today consists of a multiple sub-modules working in conjunction.
In an operational system executing varied use cases, not all modules in the SoC
need to function at their highest performing frequency all the time. To
facilitate this, sub-modules in a SoC are grouped into domains, allowing some
domains to run at lower voltage and frequency while other domains run at
voltage/frequency pairs that are higher.

The set of discrete tuples consisting of frequency and voltage pairs that
the device will support per domain are called Operating Performance Points or
OPPs.

As an example:
Let us consider an MPU device which supports the following:
{300MHz at minimum voltage of 1V}, {800MHz at minimum voltage of 1.2V},
{1GHz at minimum voltage of 1.3V}

We can represent these as three OPPs as the following {Hz, uV} tuples:
{300000000, 1000000}
{800000000, 1200000}
{1000000000, 1300000}

1.2 Operating Performance Points Library

OPP library provides a set of helper functions to organize and query the OPP
information. The library is located in drivers/base/power/opp.c and the header
is located in include/linux/opp.h. OPP library can be enabled by enabling
CONFIG_PM_OPP from power management menuconfig menu. OPP library depends on

  raid10        Various RAID10 inspired algorithms chosen by additional params
		- RAID10: Striped Mirrors (aka 'Striping on top of mirrors')
		- RAID1E: Integrated Adjacent Stripe Mirroring
		-  and other similar RAID10 variants

		synchronisation state for each region.

        [raid10_copies   <# copies>]
        [raid10_format   near]
		These two options are used to alter the default layout of
		a RAID10 configuration.  The number of copies is can be
		specified, but the default is 2.  There are other variations
		to how the copies are laid down - the default and only current
		option is "near".  Near copies are what most people think of
		with respect to mirroring.  If these options are left
		unspecified, or 'raid10_copies 2' and/or 'raid10_format near'
		are given, then the layouts for 2, 3 and 4 devices are:
		2 drives         3 drives          4 drives
		--------         ----------        --------------
		A1  A1           A1  A1  A2        A1  A1  A2  A2
		A2  A2           A2  A3  A3        A3  A3  A4  A4
		3-device layout is what might be called a 'RAID1E - Integrated
		Adjacent Stripe Mirroring'.

<#raid_devs>: The number of devices composing the array.
	Each device consists of two entries.  The first is the device
	containing the metadata (if any); the second is the one containing the
	data.
1.3.0	Added support for RAID 10
1.3.1	Allow device replacement/rebuild for RAID 10
1.3.2   Fix/improve redundancy checking for RAID10

	  This option controls verbose debugging information which can be
	  printed when the kernel detects an internal error. This debugging
	  information is useful to kernel hackers when tracking down problems,
	  but mostly meaningless to other people. It's safe to say Y unless
	  you are concerned with the code size or don't want to see these
	  messages.

			(virtualized real and unpaged mode) on capable
			Intel chips. Default is 1 (enabled)

	kvm-intel.vmentry_l1d_flush=[KVM,Intel] Mitigation for L1 Terminal Fault
			CVE-2018-3620.

			Valid arguments: never, cond, always

			always: L1D cache flush on every VMENTER.
			cond:	Flush L1D on VMENTER only when the code between
				VMEXIT and VMENTER can leak host memory.
			never:	Disables the mitigation

			Default is cond (do L1 cache flush in specific instances)

	kvm-intel.vpid=	[KVM,Intel] Disable Virtual Processor Identification
			feature (tagged TLBs) on capable Intel chips.
			Default is 1 (enabled)

	l1tf=           [X86] Control mitigation of the L1TF vulnerability on
			      affected CPUs

			The kernel PTE inversion protection is unconditionally
			enabled and cannot be disabled.

			full
				Provides all available mitigations for the
				L1TF vulnerability. Disables SMT and
				enables all mitigations in the
				hypervisors, i.e. unconditional L1D flush.

				SMT control and L1D flush control via the
				sysfs interface is still possible after
				boot.  Hypervisors will issue a warning
				when the first VM is started in a
				potentially insecure configuration,
				i.e. SMT enabled or L1D flush disabled.

			full,force
				Same as 'full', but disables SMT and L1D
				flush runtime control. Implies the
				'nosmt=force' command line option.
				(i.e. sysfs control of SMT is disabled.)

			flush
				Leaves SMT enabled and enables the default
				hypervisor mitigation, i.e. conditional
				L1D flush.

				SMT control and L1D flush control via the
				sysfs interface is still possible after
				boot.  Hypervisors will issue a warning
				when the first VM is started in a
				potentially insecure configuration,
				i.e. SMT enabled or L1D flush disabled.

			flush,nosmt

				Disables SMT and enables the default
				hypervisor mitigation.

				SMT control and L1D flush control via the
				sysfs interface is still possible after
				boot.  Hypervisors will issue a warning
				when the first VM is started in a
				potentially insecure configuration,
				i.e. SMT enabled or L1D flush disabled.

			flush,nowarn
				Same as 'flush', but hypervisors will not
				warn when a VM is started in a potentially
				insecure configuration.

			off
				Disables hypervisor mitigations and doesn't
				emit any warnings.

			Default is 'flush'.

	nosmt		[KNL,S390] Disable symmetric multithreading (SMT).
			Equivalent to smt=1.

			[KNL,x86] Disable symmetric multithreading (SMT).
			nosmt=force: Force disable SMT, cannot be undone
				     via the sysfs control file.

	nospectre_v2	[X86] Disable all mitigations for the Spectre variant 2
			(indirect branch prediction) vulnerability. System may
			allow data leaks with this option, which is equivalent
			to spectre_v2=off.

X509_STORE_CTX_purpose_inherit() directly. Typically applications should call
X509_STORE_CTX_set_purpose() or X509_STORE_CTX_set_trust() instead. Using this
function it is possible to set the purpose and trust values for the I<ctx> at
the same time. The I<def_purpose> and I<purpose> arguments can have the same
purpose values as described for X509_STORE_CTX_set_purpose() above. The I<trust>
argument can have the same trust values as described in
X509_STORE_CTX_set_trust() above. Any of the I<def_purpose>, I<purpose> or
I<trust> values may also have the value 0 to indicate that the supplied
parameter should be ignored. After calling this function the purpose to be used
for verification is set from the I<purpose> argument, and the trust is set from
the I<trust> argument. If I<trust> is 0 then the trust value will be set from
the default trust value for I<purpose>. If the default trust value for the
purpose is I<X509_TRUST_DEFAULT> and I<trust> is 0 then the default trust value
associated with the I<def_purpose> value is used for the trust setting instead.

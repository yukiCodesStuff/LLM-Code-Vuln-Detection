These parameters work as described in L<EVP_KDF(3)/PARAMETERS>.

=item "secret" (B<OSSL_KDF_PARAM_SECRET>) <octet string>

The shared secret used for key derivation.  This parameter sets the secret.

=item "acvp-info" (B<OSSL_KDF_PARAM_X942_ACVPINFO>) <octet string>
An optional octet string containing some additional, mutually-known public
information. Setting this value also sets "use-keybits" to 0.

=item "use-keybits" (B<OSSL_KDF_PARAM_X942_USE_KEYBITS>) <integer>

The default value of 1 will use the KEK key length (in bits) as the
"supp-pubinfo". A value of 0 disables setting the "supp-pubinfo".

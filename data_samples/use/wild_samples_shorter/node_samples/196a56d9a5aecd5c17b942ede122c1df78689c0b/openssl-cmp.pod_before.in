X509 Distinguished Name (DN) of subject to use in the requested certificate
template.
For KUR, it defaults to the public key
in the PKCS#10 CSR given with the B<-csr> option, if provided,
or of the reference certificate (see B<-oldcert>) if provided.
This default is used for IR and CR only if no SANs are set.
If the NULL-DN (C<"/">) is given then no subject is placed in the template.

If provided and neither B<-cert> nor B<-oldcert> is given,
the subject DN is used as fallback sender of outgoing CMP messages.


PKCS#10 CSR in PEM or DER format containing a certificate request.
With B<-cmd> I<p10cr> it is used directly in a legacy P10CR message.
When used with B<-cmd> I<ir>, I<cr>, or I<kur>, it is transformed into the
respective regular CMP request.
It may also be used with B<-cmd> I<rr> to specify the certificate to be revoked
via the included subject name and public key.

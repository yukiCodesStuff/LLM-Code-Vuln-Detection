=head1 DESCRIPTION

X509_CRL_get0_by_serial() attempts to find a revoked entry in B<crl> for
serial number B<serial>. If it is successful it sets B<*ret> to the internal
pointer of the matching entry, as a result B<*ret> must not be freed up
after the call.

X509_CRL_get0_by_cert() is similar to X509_get0_by_serial() except it
looks for a revoked entry using the serial number of certificate B<x>.

X509_CRL_get_REVOKED() returns an internal pointer to a stack of all
revoked entries for B<crl>.

X509_REVOKED_get0_serialNumber() returns an internal pointer to the
serial number of B<r>.

X509_REVOKED_get0_revocationDate() returns an internal pointer to the
revocation date of B<r>.

X509_REVOKED_set_serialNumber() sets the serial number of B<r> to B<serial>.
The supplied B<serial> pointer is not used internally so it should be
freed up after use.

X509_REVOKED_set_revocationDate() sets the revocation date of B<r> to
B<tm>. The supplied B<tm> pointer is not used internally so it should be
freed up after use.

X509_CRL_add0_revoked() appends revoked entry B<rev> to CRL B<crl>. The
pointer B<rev> is used internally so it must not be freed up after the call:
it is freed when the parent CRL is freed.

X509_CRL_sort() sorts the revoked entries of B<crl> into ascending serial
number order.

=head1 NOTES

Applications can determine the number of revoked entries returned by
X509_CRL_get_revoked() using sk_X509_REVOKED_num() and examine each one
in turn using sk_X509_REVOKED_value().

=head1 RETURN VALUES

1 on success except if the revoked entry has the reason C<removeFromCRL> (8),
in which case 2 is returned.

X509_REVOKED_set_serialNumber(), X509_REVOKED_set_revocationDate(),
X509_CRL_add0_revoked() and X509_CRL_sort() return 1 for success and 0 for
failure.

X509_REVOKED_get0_serialNumber() returns an B<ASN1_INTEGER> pointer.

X509_REVOKED_get0_revocationDate() returns an B<ASN1_TIME> value.

X509_CRL_get_REVOKED() returns a STACK of revoked entries.

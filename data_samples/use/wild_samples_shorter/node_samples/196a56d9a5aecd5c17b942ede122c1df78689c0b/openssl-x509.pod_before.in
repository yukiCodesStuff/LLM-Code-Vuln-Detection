Sets the CA serial number file to use.

When the B<-CA> option is used to sign a certificate it uses a serial
number specified in a file. This file consists of one line containing
an even number of hex digits with the serial number to use. After each
use the serial number is incremented and written out to the file again.

The default filename consists of the CA certificate file base name with
F<.srl> appended. For example if the CA certificate file is called
F<mycacert.pem> it expects to find a serial number file called
F<mycacert.srl>.

=item B<-CAcreateserial>

With this option the CA serial number file is created if it does not exist:
it will contain the serial number "02" and the certificate being signed will
have the 1 as its serial number. If the B<-CA> option is specified
and the serial number file does not exist a random number is generated;
this is the recommended practice.

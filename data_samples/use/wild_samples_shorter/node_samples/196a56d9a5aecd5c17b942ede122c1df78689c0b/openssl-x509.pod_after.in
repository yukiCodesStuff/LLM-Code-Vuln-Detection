Sets the CA serial number file to use.

When creating a certificate with this option and with the B<-CA> option,
the certificate serial number is stored in the given file.
This file consists of one line containing
an even number of hex digits with the serial number used last time.
After reading this number, it is incremented and used, and the file is updated.

The default filename consists of the CA certificate file base name with
F<.srl> appended. For example if the CA certificate file is called
F<mycacert.pem> it expects to find a serial number file called
F<mycacert.srl>.

If the B<-CA> option is specified and neither <-CAserial> or <-CAcreateserial>
is given and the default serial number file does not exist,
a random number is generated; this is the recommended practice.

=item B<-CAcreateserial>

With this option and the B<-CA> option
the CA serial number file is created if it does not exist.
A random number is generated, used for the certificate,
and saved into the serial number file determined as described above.

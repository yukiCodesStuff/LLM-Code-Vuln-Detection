=head1 DESCRIPTION

PKCS7_sign_ex() creates and returns a PKCS#7 signedData structure.
I<igncert> is the certificate to sign with, Ipkey> is the corresponding
private key. I<certs> is an optional additional set of certificates to include
in the PKCS#7 structure (for example any intermediate CAs in the chain). The
library context I<libctx> and property query I<propq> are used when
retrieving algorithms from providers.

The data to be signed is read from BIO B<data>.

B<flags> is an optional set of flags.

Any of the following flags (ored together) can be passed in the B<flags>
parameter.

Many S/MIME clients expect the signed content to include valid MIME headers. If
the B<PKCS7_TEXT> flag is set MIME headers for type B<text/plain> are prepended
to the data.

If B<PKCS7_NOCERTS> is set the signer's certificate will not be included in the
PKCS7 structure, the signer's certificate must still be supplied in the
B<signcert> parameter though. This can reduce the size of the signature if the
signers certificate can be obtained by other means: for example a previously
signed message.

The data being signed is included in the PKCS7 structure, unless
B<PKCS7_DETACHED> is set in which case it is omitted. This is used for PKCS7
detached signatures which are used in S/MIME plaintext signed messages for

If the flags B<PKCS7_STREAM> is set then the returned B<PKCS7> structure is
just initialized ready to perform the signing operation. The signing is however
B<not> performed and the data to be signed is not read from the B<data>
parameter. Signing is deferred until after the data has been written. In this
way data can be signed in a single pass.

If the B<PKCS7_PARTIAL> flag is set a partial B<PKCS7> structure is output to
If a signer is specified it will use the default digest for the signing
algorithm. This is B<SHA1> for both RSA and DSA keys.

The B<certs>, B<signcert> and B<pkey> parameters can all be
B<NULL> if the B<PKCS7_PARTIAL> flag is set. One or more signers can be added
using the function PKCS7_sign_add_signer(). PKCS7_final() must also be
called to finalize the structure if streaming is not enabled. Alternative
signing digests can also be specified using this method.

If B<signcert> and B<pkey> are NULL then a certificates only
PKCS#7 structure is output.

In versions of OpenSSL before 1.0.0 the B<signcert> and B<pkey> parameters must
B<NOT> be NULL.

PKCS7_sign() is similar to PKCS7_sign_ex() but uses default values of
NULL for the library context I<libctx> and the property query I<propq>.

=head1 BUGS

Some advanced attributes such as counter signatures are not supported.

The function PKCS7_sign_ex() was added in OpenSSL 3.0.

The B<PKCS7_PARTIAL> flag, and the ability for B<certs>, B<signcert>,
and B<pkey> parameters to be B<NULL> were added in OpenSSL 1.0.0.

The B<PKCS7_STREAM> flag was added in OpenSSL 1.0.0.

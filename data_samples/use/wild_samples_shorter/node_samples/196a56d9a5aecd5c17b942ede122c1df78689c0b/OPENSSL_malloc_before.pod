failing.

If the variable B<OPENSSL_MALLOC_FD> is parsed as a positive integer, then
it is taken as an open file descriptor, and a record of all allocations is
written to that descriptor.  If an allocation will fail, and the platform
supports it, then a backtrace will be written to the descriptor.  This can
be useful because a malloc may fail but not be checked, and problems will
only occur later.  The following example in classic shell syntax shows how
to use this (will not work on all platforms):

  OPENSSL_MALLOC_FAILURES='200;@10'
  export OPENSSL_MALLOC_FAILURES
  OPENSSL_MALLOC_FD=3
always because allocations have already happened).

# Domain
<!-- YAML
changes:
  - version: v8.8.0
    description: Any `Promise`s created in VM contexts no longer have a
                 `.domain` property. Their handlers are still executed in the
                 proper domain, however, and `Promise`s created in the main
                 context still possess a `.domain` property.

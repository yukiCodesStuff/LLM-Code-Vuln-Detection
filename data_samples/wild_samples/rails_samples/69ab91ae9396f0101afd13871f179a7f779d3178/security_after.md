This returned "some&lt;script&gt;alert('hello')&lt;/script&gt;", which makes an attack work. That's why I vote for a whitelist approach, using the updated Rails 2 method sanitize():

```ruby
tags = %w(a acronym b strong i em li ul ol h1 h2 h3 h4 h5 h6 blockquote br cite sub sup ins p)
s = sanitize(user_input, tags: tags, attributes: %w(href title))
```

This allows only the given tags and does a good job, even against all kinds of tricks and malformed tags.

As a second step, _it is good practice to escape all output of the application_, especially when re-displaying user input, which hasn't been input-filtered (as in the search form example earlier on). _Use `escapeHTML()` (or its alias `h()`) method_ to replace the HTML input characters &amp;, &quot;, &lt;, &gt; by their uninterpreted representations in HTML (`&amp;`, `&quot;`, `&lt`;, and `&gt;`). However, it can easily happen that the programmer forgets to use it, so _it is recommended to use the [SafeErb](http://safe-erb.rubyforge.org/svn/plugins/safe_erb/) plugin_. SafeErb reminds you to escape strings from external sources.

##### Obfuscation and Encoding Injection

Network traffic is mostly based on the limited Western alphabet, so new character encodings, such as Unicode, emerged, to transmit characters in other languages. But, this is also a threat to web applications, as malicious code can be hidden in different encodings that the web browser might be able to process, but the web application might not. Here is an attack vector in UTF-8 encoding:

```
<IMG SRC=&#106;&#97;&#118;&#97;&#115;&#99;&#114;&#105;&#112;&#116;&#58;&#97;
  &#108;&#101;&#114;&#116;&#40;&#39;&#88;&#83;&#83;&#39;&#41;>
```

This example pops up a message box. It will be recognized by the above sanitize() filter, though. A great tool to obfuscate and encode strings, and thus "get to know your enemy", is the [Hackvertor](https://hackvertor.co.uk/public). Rails' sanitize() method does a good job to fend off encoding attacks.

#### Examples from the Underground

_In order to understand today's attacks on web applications, it's best to take a look at some real-world attack vectors._

The following is an excerpt from the [Js.Yamanner@m](http://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2006-061211-4111-99&tabid=1) Yahoo! Mail [worm](http://groovin.net/stuff/yammer.txt). It appeared on June 11, 2006 and was the first webmail interface worm:

```
<img src='http://us.i1.yimg.com/us.yimg.com/i/us/nt/ma/ma_mail_1.gif'
  target=""onload="var http_request = false;    var Email = '';
  var IDList = '';   var CRumb = '';   function makeRequest(url, Func, Method,Param) { ...
```

The worms exploits a hole in Yahoo's HTML/JavaScript filter, which usually filters all target and onload attributes from tags (because there can be JavaScript). The filter is applied only once, however, so the onload attribute with the worm code stays in place. This is a good example why blacklist filters are never complete and why it is hard to allow HTML/JavaScript in a web application.

Another proof-of-concept webmail worm is Nduja, a cross-domain worm for four Italian webmail services. Find more details on [Rosario Valotta's paper](http://www.xssed.com/news/37/Nduja_Connection_A_cross_webmail_worm_XWW/). Both webmail worms have the goal to harvest email addresses, something a criminal hacker could make money with.

In December 2006, 34,000 actual user names and passwords were stolen in a [MySpace phishing attack](http://news.netcraft.com/archives/2006/10/27/myspace_accounts_compromised_by_phishers.html). The idea of the attack was to create a profile page named "login_home_index_html", so the URL looked very convincing. Specially-crafted HTML and CSS was used to hide the genuine MySpace content from the page and instead display its own login form.

The MySpace Samy worm will be discussed in the CSS Injection section.

### CSS Injection

INFO: _CSS Injection is actually JavaScript injection, because some browsers (IE, some versions of Safari and others) allow JavaScript in CSS. Think twice about allowing custom CSS in your web application._

CSS Injection is explained best by a well-known worm, the [MySpace Samy worm](http://namb.la/popular/tech.html). This worm automatically sent a friend request to Samy (the attacker) simply by visiting his profile. Within several hours he had over 1 million friend requests, but it creates too much traffic on MySpace, so that the site goes offline. The following is a technical explanation of the worm.

MySpace blocks many tags, however it allows CSS. So the worm's author put JavaScript into CSS like this:

```html
<div style="background:url('javascript:alert(1)')">
```

So the payload is in the style attribute. But there are no quotes allowed in the payload, because single and double quotes have already been used. But JavaScript has a handy eval() function which executes any string as code.

```html
<div id="mycode" expr="alert('hah!')" style="background:url('javascript:eval(document.all.mycode.expr)')">
```

The eval() function is a nightmare for blacklist input filters, as it allows the style attribute to hide the word "innerHTML":

```
alert(eval('document.body.inne' + 'rHTML'));
```

The next problem was MySpace filtering the word "javascript", so the author used "java&lt;NEWLINE&gt;script" to get around this:

```html
<div id="mycode" expr="alert('hah!')" style="background:url('javaâ†µ
script:eval(document.all.mycode.expr)')">
```

Another problem for the worm's author were CSRF security tokens. Without them he couldn't send a friend request over POST. He got around it by sending a GET to the page right before adding a user and parsing the result for the CSRF token.

In the end, he got a 4 KB worm, which he injected into his profile page.

The [moz-binding](http://www.securiteam.com/securitynews/5LP051FHPE.html) CSS property proved to be another way to introduce JavaScript in CSS in Gecko-based browsers (Firefox, for example).

#### Countermeasures

This example, again, showed that a blacklist filter is never complete. However, as custom CSS in web applications is a quite rare feature, I am not aware of a whitelist CSS filter. _If you want to allow custom colors or images, you can allow the user to choose them and build the CSS in the web application_. Use Rails' `sanitize()` method as a model for a whitelist CSS filter, if you really need one.

### Textile Injection

If you want to provide text formatting other than HTML (due to security), use a mark-up language which is converted to HTML on the server-side. [RedCloth](http://redcloth.org/) is such a language for Ruby, but without precautions, it is also vulnerable to XSS.

For example, RedCloth translates `_test_` to &lt;em&gt;test&lt;em&gt;, which makes the text italic. However, up to the current version 3.0.4, it is still vulnerable to XSS. Get the [all-new version 4](http://www.redcloth.org) that removed serious bugs. However, even that version has [some security bugs](http://www.rorsecurity.info/journal/2008/10/13/new-redcloth-security.html), so the countermeasures still apply. Here is an example for version 3.0.4:

```ruby
RedCloth.new('<script>alert(1)</script>').to_html
# => "<script>alert(1)</script>"
```

Use the :filter_html option to remove HTML which was not created by the Textile processor.

```ruby
RedCloth.new('<script>alert(1)</script>', [:filter_html]).to_html
# => "alert(1)"
```

However, this does not filter all HTML, a few tags will be left (by design), for example &lt;a&gt;:

```ruby
RedCloth.new("<a href='javascript:alert(1)'>hello</a>", [:filter_html]).to_html
# => "<p><a href="javascript:alert(1)">hello</a></p>"
```

#### Countermeasures

It is recommended to _use RedCloth in combination with a whitelist input filter_, as described in the countermeasures against XSS section.

### Ajax Injection

NOTE: _The same security precautions have to be taken for Ajax actions as for "normal" ones. There is at least one exception, however: The output has to be escaped in the controller already, if the action doesn't render a view._

If you use the [in_place_editor plugin](http://dev.rubyonrails.org/browser/plugins/in_place_editing), or actions that return a string, rather than rendering a view, _you have to escape the return value in the action_. Otherwise, if the return value contains a XSS string, the malicious code will be executed upon return to the browser. Escape any input value using the h() method.

### Command Line Injection

NOTE: _Use user-supplied command line parameters with caution._

If your application has to execute commands in the underlying operating system, there are several methods in Ruby: exec(command), syscall(command), system(command) and `command`. You will have to be especially careful with these functions if the user may enter the whole command, or a part of it. This is because in most shells, you can execute another command at the end of the first one, concatenating them with a semicolon (;) or a vertical bar (|).

A countermeasure is to _use the `system(command, parameters)` method which passes command line parameters safely_.

```ruby
system("/bin/echo","hello; rm *")
# prints "hello; rm *" and does not delete files
```


### Header Injection

WARNING: _HTTP headers are dynamically generated and under certain circumstances user input may be injected. This can lead to false redirection, XSS or HTTP response splitting._

HTTP request headers have a Referer, User-Agent (client software), and Cookie field, among others. Response headers for example have a status code, Cookie and Location (redirection target URL) field. All of them are user-supplied and may be manipulated with more or less effort. _Remember to escape these header fields, too._ For example when you display the user agent in an administration area.

Besides that, it is _important to know what you are doing when building response headers partly based on user input._ For example you want to redirect the user back to a specific page. To do that you introduced a "referer" field in a form to redirect to the given address:

```ruby
redirect_to params[:referer]
```

What happens is that Rails puts the string into the Location header field and sends a 302 (redirect) status to the browser. The first thing a malicious user would do, is this:

```
http://www.yourapplication.com/controller/action?referer=http://www.malicious.tld
```

And due to a bug in (Ruby and) Rails up to version 2.1.2 (excluding it), a hacker may inject arbitrary header fields; for example like this:

```
http://www.yourapplication.com/controller/action?referer=http://www.malicious.tld%0d%0aX-Header:+Hi!
http://www.yourapplication.com/controller/action?referer=path/at/your/app%0d%0aLocation:+http://www.malicious.tld
```

Note that "%0d%0a" is URL-encoded for "\r\n" which is a carriage-return and line-feed (CRLF) in Ruby. So the resulting HTTP header for the second example will be the following because the second Location header field overwrites the first.

```
HTTP/1.1 302 Moved Temporarily
(...)
Location: http://www.malicious.tld
```

So _attack vectors for Header Injection are based on the injection of CRLF characters in a header field._ And what could an attacker do with a false redirection? They could redirect to a phishing site that looks the same as yours, but ask to login again (and sends the login credentials to the attacker). Or they could install malicious software through browser security holes on that site. Rails 2.1.2 escapes these characters for the Location field in the `redirect_to` method. _Make sure you do it yourself when you build other header fields with user input._

#### Response Splitting

If Header Injection was possible, Response Splitting might be, too. In HTTP, the header block is followed by two CRLFs and the actual data (usually HTML). The idea of Response Splitting is to inject two CRLFs into a header field, followed by another response with malicious HTML. The response will be:

```
HTTP/1.1 302 Found [First standard 302 response]
Date: Tue, 12 Apr 2005 22:09:07 GMT
Location:
Content-Type: text/html


HTTP/1.1 200 OK [Second New response created by attacker begins]
Content-Type: text/html


&lt;html&gt;&lt;font color=red&gt;hey&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/html&gt; [Arbitary malicious input is
Keep-Alive: timeout=15, max=100         shown as the redirected page]
Connection: Keep-Alive
Transfer-Encoding: chunked
Content-Type: text/html
```

Under certain circumstances this would present the malicious HTML to the victim. However, this only seems to work with Keep-Alive connections (and many browsers are using one-time connections). But you can't rely on this. _In any case this is a serious bug, and you should update your Rails to version 2.0.5 or 2.1.2 to eliminate Header Injection (and thus response splitting) risks._

Unsafe Query Generation
-----------------------

Due to the way Active Record interprets parameters in combination with the way
that Rack parses query parameters it was possible to issue unexpected database
queries with `IS NULL` where clauses. As a response to that security issue
([CVE-2012-2660](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/rubyonrails-security/deep_munge/rubyonrails-security/8SA-M3as7A8/Mr9fi9X4kNgJ),
[CVE-2012-2694](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/rubyonrails-security/deep_munge/rubyonrails-security/jILZ34tAHF4/7x0hLH-o0-IJ)
and [CVE-2013-0155](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/rubyonrails-security/CVE-2012-2660/rubyonrails-security/c7jT-EeN9eI/L0u4e87zYGMJ))
`deep_munge` method was introduced as a solution to keep Rails secure by default.

Example of vulnerable code that could be used by attacker, if `deep_munge`
wasn't performed is:

```ruby
unless params[:token].nil?
  user = User.find_by_token(params[:token])
  user.reset_password!
end
```

When `params[:token]` is one of: `[]`, `[nil]`, `[nil, nil, ...]` or
`['foo', nil]` it will bypass the test for `nil`, but `IS NULL` or
`IN ('foo', NULL)` where clauses still will be added to the SQL query.

To keep rails secure by default, `deep_munge` replaces some of the values with
`nil`. Below table shows what the parameters look like based on `JSON` sent in
request:

| JSON                              | Parameters               |
|-----------------------------------|--------------------------|
| `{ "person": null }`              | `{ :person => nil }`     |
| `{ "person": [] }`                | `{ :person => nil }`     |
| `{ "person": [null] }`            | `{ :person => nil }`     |
| `{ "person": [null, null, ...] }` | `{ :person => nil }`     |
| `{ "person": ["foo", null] }`     | `{ :person => ["foo"] }` |

It is possible to return to old behaviour and disable `deep_munge` configuring
your application if you are aware of the risk and know how to handle it:

```ruby
config.action_dispatch.perform_deep_munge = false
```

Default Headers
---------------

Every HTTP response from your Rails application receives the following default security headers.

```ruby
config.action_dispatch.default_headers = {
  'X-Frame-Options' => 'SAMEORIGIN',
  'X-XSS-Protection' => '1; mode=block',
  'X-Content-Type-Options' => 'nosniff'
}

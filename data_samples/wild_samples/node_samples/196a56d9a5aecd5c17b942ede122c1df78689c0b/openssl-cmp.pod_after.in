=head1 DESCRIPTION

The B<cmp> command is a client implementation for the Certificate
Management Protocol (CMP) as defined in RFC4210.
It can be used to request certificates from a CA server,
update their certificates,
request certificates to be revoked, and perform other types of CMP requests.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<-help>

Display a summary of all options

=item B<-config> I<filename>

Configuration file to use.
An empty string C<""> means none.
Default filename is from the environment variable C<OPENSSL_CONF>.

=item B<-section> I<names>

Section(s) to use within config file defining CMP options.
An empty string C<""> means no specific section.
Default is C<cmp>.

Multiple section names may be given, separated by commas and/or whitespace
(where in the latter case the whole argument must be enclosed in "...").
Contents of sections named later may override contents of sections named before.
In any case, as usual, the C<[default]> section and finally the unnamed
section (as far as present) can provide per-option fallback values.

=item B<-verbosity> I<level>

Level of verbosity for logging, error output, etc.
0 = EMERG, 1 = ALERT, 2 = CRIT, 3 = ERR, 4 = WARN, 5 = NOTE,
6 = INFO, 7 = DEBUG, 8 = TRACE.
Defaults to 6 = INFO.

=back

=head2 Generic message options

=over 4

=item B<-cmd> I<ir|cr|kur|p10cr|rr|genm>

CMP command to execute.
Currently implemented commands are:

=over 8

=item  ir E<nbsp>  - Initialization Request

=item  cr E<nbsp>  - Certificate Request

=item  p10cr - PKCS#10 Certification Request (for legacy support)

=item  kur E<nbsp>E<nbsp>- Key Update Request

=item  rr E<nbsp>  - Revocation Request

=item  genm  - General Message

=back

B<ir> requests initialization of an end entity into a PKI hierarchy
by issuing a first certificate.

B<cr> requests issuing an additional certificate for an end entity already
initialized to the PKI hierarchy.

B<p10cr> requests issuing an additional certificate similarly to B<cr>
but using legacy PKCS#10 CSR format.

B<kur> requests a (key) update for an existing certificate.

B<rr> requests revocation of an existing certificate.

B<genm> requests information using a General Message, where optionally
included B<InfoTypeAndValue>s may be used to state which info is of interest.
Upon receipt of the General Response, information about all received
ITAV B<infoType>s is printed to stdout.

=item B<-infotype> I<name>

Set InfoType name to use for requesting specific info in B<genm>,
e.g., C<signKeyPairTypes>.

=item B<-geninfo> I<OID:int:N>

generalInfo integer values to place in request PKIHeader with given OID,
e.g., C<1.2.3.4:int:56789>.

=back

=head2 Certificate enrollment options

=over 4

=item B<-newkey> I<filename>|I<uri>

The source of the private or public key for the certificate requested
in Initialization Request (IR), Certification Request(CR), or
Key Update Request (KUR).
Defaults to the public key in the PKCS#10 CSR given with the B<-csr> option,
the public key of the reference certificate, or the current client key.

=item B<-newkeypass> I<arg>

Pass phrase source for the key given with the B<-newkey> option.
If not given here, the password will be prompted for if needed.

For more information about the format of I<arg> see
L<openssl-passphrase-options(1)>.

=item B<-subject> I<name>

X509 Distinguished Name (DN) of subject to use in the requested certificate
template.
If the NULL-DN (C<"/">) is given then no subject is placed in the template.
Default is the subject DN of any PKCS#10 CSR given with the B<-csr> option.
For KUR, a further fallback is the subject DN
of the reference certificate (see B<-oldcert>) if provided.
This fallback is used for IR and CR only if no SANs are set.

If provided and neither B<-cert> nor B<-oldcert> is given,
the subject DN is used as fallback sender of outgoing CMP messages.

The argument must be formatted as I</type0=value0/type1=value1/type2=...>.
Special characters may be escaped by C<\> (backslash); whitespace is retained.
Empty values are permitted, but the corresponding type will not be included.
Giving a single C</> will lead to an empty sequence of RDNs (a NULL-DN).
Multi-valued RDNs can be formed by placing a C<+> character instead of a C</>
between the AttributeValueAssertions (AVAs) that specify the members of the set.
Example:

C</DC=org/DC=OpenSSL/DC=users/UID=123456+CN=John Doe>

=item B<-issuer> I<name>

X509 issuer Distinguished Name (DN) of the CA server
to place in the requested certificate template in IR/CR/KUR.
If the NULL-DN (C<"/">) is given then no issuer is placed in the template.

If provided and neither B<-recipient> nor B<-srvcert> is given,
the issuer DN is used as fallback recipient of outgoing CMP messages.

The argument must be formatted as I</type0=value0/type1=value1/type2=...>.
For details see the description of the B<-subject> option.

=item B<-days> I<number>

Number of days the new certificate is requested to be valid for, counting from
the current time of the host.
Also triggers the explicit request that the
validity period starts from the current time (as seen by the host).

=item B<-reqexts> I<name>

Name of section in OpenSSL config file defining certificate request extensions.
If the B<-csr> option is present, these extensions augment the extensions
contained the given PKCS#10 CSR, overriding any extensions with same OIDs.

=item B<-sans> I<spec>

One or more IP addresses, DNS names, or URIs separated by commas or whitespace
(where in the latter case the whole argument must be enclosed in "...")
to add as Subject Alternative Name(s) (SAN) certificate request extension.
If the special element "critical" is given the SANs are flagged as critical.
Cannot be used if any Subject Alternative Name extension is set via B<-reqexts>.

=item B<-san_nodefault>

When Subject Alternative Names are not given via B<-sans>
nor defined via B<-reqexts>,
they are copied by default from the reference certificate (see B<-oldcert>).
This can be disabled by giving the B<-san_nodefault> option.

=item B<-policies> I<name>

Name of section in OpenSSL config file defining policies to be set
as certificate request extension.
This option cannot be used together with B<-policy_oids>.

=item B<-policy_oids> I<names>

This option cannot be used together with B<-policies>.

=item B<-policy_oids_critical>

Flag the policies given with B<-policy_oids> as critical.

=item B<-popo> I<number>

Proof-of-Possession (POPO) method to use for IR/CR/KUR; values: C<-1>..<2> where
C<-1> = NONE, C<0> = RAVERIFIED, C<1> = SIGNATURE (default), C<2> = KEYENC.

Note that a signature-based POPO can only be produced if a private key
is provided via the B<-newkey> or B<-key> options.

=item B<-csr> I<filename>

PKCS#10 CSR in PEM or DER format containing a certificate request.
With B<-cmd> I<p10cr> it is used directly in a legacy P10CR message.
When used with B<-cmd> I<ir>, I<cr>, or I<kur>,
it is transformed into the respective regular CMP request,
while its public key is ignored if I<-newkey> is given.
It may also be used with B<-cmd> I<rr> to specify the certificate to be revoked
via the included subject name and public key.

=item B<-out_trusted> I<filenames>|I<uris>

Trusted certificate(s) to use for validating the newly enrolled certificate.

Multiple sources may be given, separated by commas and/or whitespace
(where in the latter case the whole argument must be enclosed in "...").
Each source may contain multiple certificates.

The certificate verification options
B<-verify_hostname>, B<-verify_ip>, and B<-verify_email>
only affect the certificate verification enabled via this option.

=item B<-implicit_confirm>

Request implicit confirmation of newly enrolled certificates.

=item B<-disable_confirm>

Do not send certificate confirmation message for newly enrolled certificate
without requesting implicit confirmation
to cope with broken servers not supporting implicit confirmation correctly.
B<WARNING:> This leads to behavior violating RFC 4210.

=item B<-certout> I<filename>

The file where the newly enrolled certificate should be saved.

=item B<-chainout> I<filename>

The file where the chain of the newly enrolled certificate should be saved.

=back

=head2 Certificate enrollment and revocation options

=over 4

=item B<-oldcert> I<filename>|I<uri>

The certificate to be updated (i.e., renewed or re-keyed) in Key Update Request
(KUR) messages or to be revoked in Revocation Request (RR) messages.
For KUR the certificate to be updated defaults to B<-cert>,
and the resulting certificate is called I<reference certificate>.
For RR the certificate to be revoked can also be specified using B<-csr>.

The reference certificate, if any, is also used for
deriving default subject DN and Subject Alternative Names and the
default issuer entry in the requested certificate template of an IR/CR/KUR.
Its subject is used as sender of outgoing messages if B<-cert> is not given.
Its issuer is used as default recipient in CMP message headers
if neither B<-recipient>, B<-srvcert>, nor B<-issuer> is given.

=item B<-revreason> I<number>

Set CRLReason to be included in revocation request (RR); values: C<0>..C<10>
or C<-1> for none (which is the default).

Reason numbers defined in RFC 5280 are:

   CRLReason ::= ENUMERATED {
        unspecified             (0),
        keyCompromise           (1),

(where in the latter case the whole argument must be enclosed in "...").
Each source may contain multiple certificates.

The certificate verification options
B<-verify_hostname>, B<-verify_ip>, and B<-verify_email>
only affect the certificate verification enabled via this option.

=item B<-implicit_confirm>

Request implicit confirmation of newly enrolled certificates.

=item B<-disable_confirm>

Do not send certificate confirmation message for newly enrolled certificate
without requesting implicit confirmation
to cope with broken servers not supporting implicit confirmation correctly.
B<WARNING:> This leads to behavior violating RFC 4210.

=item B<-certout> I<filename>

The file where the newly enrolled certificate should be saved.

=item B<-chainout> I<filename>

The file where the chain of the newly enrolled certificate should be saved.

=over 4

=item B<-oldcert> I<filename>|I<uri>

The certificate to be updated (i.e., renewed or re-keyed) in Key Update Request
(KUR) messages or to be revoked in Revocation Request (RR) messages.
For KUR the certificate to be updated defaults to B<-cert>,
and the resulting certificate is called I<reference certificate>.
For RR the certificate to be revoked can also be specified using B<-csr>.

The reference certificate, if any, is also used for
deriving default subject DN and Subject Alternative Names and the
default issuer entry in the requested certificate template of an IR/CR/KUR.
Its subject is used as sender of outgoing messages if B<-cert> is not given.
Its issuer is used as default recipient in CMP message headers
if neither B<-recipient>, B<-srvcert>, nor B<-issuer> is given.

=item B<-revreason> I<number>

Set CRLReason to be included in revocation request (RR); values: C<0>..C<10>
or C<-1> for none (which is the default).

Reason numbers defined in RFC 5280 are:

   CRLReason ::= ENUMERATED {
        unspecified             (0),
        keyCompromise           (1),

s64 SHOULD be printed with %lld/%llx, (long long):

	printk("%lld", (long long)s64_var);

If <type> is dependent on a config option for its size (e.g., sector_t,
blkcnt_t) or is architecture-dependent for its size (e.g., tcflag_t), use a
format specifier of its largest possible type and explicitly cast to it.
Example:

	printk("test: sector number/total blocks: %llu/%llu\n",
		(unsigned long long)sector, (unsigned long long)blockcount);

Reminder: sizeof() result is of type size_t.

Thank you for your cooperation and attention.

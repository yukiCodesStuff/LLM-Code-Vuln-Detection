  3.2 Frame format:
  If flag IFF_NO_PI is not set each frame format is: 
     Flags [2 bytes]
     Proto [2 bytes]
     Raw protocol(IP, IPv6, etc) frame.

Universal TUN/TAP device driver Frequently Asked Question.
   
1. What platforms are supported by TUN/TAP driver ?
Currently driver has been written for 3 Unices:
   Linux kernels 2.2.x, 2.4.x 
   FreeBSD 3.x, 4.x, 5.x
   Solaris 2.6, 7.0, 8.0

2. What is TUN/TAP driver used for?
As mentioned above, main purpose of TUN/TAP driver is tunneling. 
It is used by VTun (http://vtun.sourceforge.net).

Another interesting application using TUN/TAP is pipsecd
(http://perso.enst.fr/~beyssac/pipsec/), a userspace IPSec
implementation that can use complete kernel routing (unlike FreeS/WAN).

3. How does Virtual network device actually work ? 
Virtual network device can be viewed as a simple Point-to-Point or
Ethernet device, which instead of receiving packets from a physical 
media, receives them from user space program and instead of sending 
packets via physical media sends them to the user space program. 

Let's say that you configured IPX on the tap0, then whenever 
the kernel sends an IPX packet to tap0, it is passed to the application
(VTun for example). The application encrypts, compresses and sends it to 
the other side over TCP or UDP. The application on the other side decompresses
and decrypts the data received and writes the packet to the TAP device, 
the kernel handles the packet like it came from real physical device.

4. What is the difference between TUN driver and TAP driver?
TUN works with IP frames. TAP works with Ethernet frames.

This means that you have to read/write IP packets when you are using tun and
ethernet frames when using tap.

5. What is the difference between BPF and TUN/TAP driver?
BPF is an advanced packet filter. It can be attached to existing
network interface. It does not provide a virtual network interface.
A TUN/TAP driver does provide a virtual network interface and it is possible
to attach BPF to this interface.

6. Does TAP driver support kernel Ethernet bridging?
Yes. Linux and FreeBSD drivers support Ethernet bridging.

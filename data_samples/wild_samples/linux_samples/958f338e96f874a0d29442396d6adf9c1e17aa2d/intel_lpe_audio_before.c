/**
 * DOC: LPE Audio integration for HDMI or DP playback
 *
 * Motivation:
 * Atom platforms (e.g. valleyview and cherryTrail) integrates a DMA-based
 * interface as an alternative to the traditional HDaudio path. While this
 * mode is unrelated to the LPE aka SST audio engine, the documentation refers
 * to this mode as LPE so we keep this notation for the sake of consistency.
 *
 * The interface is handled by a separate standalone driver maintained in the
 * ALSA subsystem for simplicity. To minimize the interaction between the two
 * subsystems, a bridge is setup between the hdmi-lpe-audio and i915:
 * 1. Create a platform device to share MMIO/IRQ resources
 * 2. Make the platform device child of i915 device for runtime PM.
 * 3. Create IRQ chip to forward the LPE audio irqs.
 * the hdmi-lpe-audio driver probes the lpe audio device and creates a new
 * sound card
 *
 * Threats:
 * Due to the restriction in Linux platform device model, user need manually
 * uninstall the hdmi-lpe-audio driver before uninstalling i915 module,
 * otherwise we might run into use-after-free issues after i915 removes the
 * platform device: even though hdmi-lpe-audio driver is released, the modules
 * is still in "installed" status.
 *
 * Implementation:
 * The MMIO/REG platform resources are created according to the registers
 * specification.
 * When forwarding LPE audio irqs, the flow control handler selection depends
 * on the platform, for example on valleyview handle_simple_irq is enough.
 *

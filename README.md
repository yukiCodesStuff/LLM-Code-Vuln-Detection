# Using LLMs to detect Code Vulnerabilities
The attached report details the implementation and evaluation of large language models (LLMs) in detecting and analyzing code vulnerabilities using retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). The project integrates Claude 3.5 Sonnet and OpenAI's GPT-4 models with a MongoDB database containing vector-embedded datasets sourced from Hugging Face. By leveraging RAG, the models were tested for their ability to identify vulnerabilities in 40 files, achieving detection accuracies of 75% and 85% for Claude and OpenAI, respectively. Limitations such as funding constraints, time restrictions, and a lack of automated evaluation methods for advanced capabilities are discussed, alongside recommendations for future improvements to optimize the systemâ€™s performance in real-world scenarios.
